### Why not NotchLC?
Besides my personal preference for HAP (more layers and better performance at the trade off of slightly less quality)... NotchLC is a proprietary codec and has no plans on being shared outside of Notch and their own Media Encoder plugin. This means that in cannot be used in open source programs such as this one or FFmpeg. [Notch has made it clear that they are not interested in open sourcing their codec](https://forum.notch.one/t/command-line-encode-utility/851/13). If this is something you need, and it is becoming more difficult to encode to NotchLC due to Adobe / Apple's silicone, I would recommend contacting Notch.
