### Why not NotchLC?
NotchLC is a proprietary codec and has no plans on being shared. This means that in cannot be used in open source programs such as this one or FFmpeg. [Notch has made it clear that they are not interested in open sourcing their codec](https://forum.notch.one/t/command-line-encode-utility/851/13).
